## Reason for Modification

Maker Oracles have two crucial concepts - Feeds and Relayers.

Feed is a price submitter (currently there are more than 20 of them). These are appointed my MakerDAO governance and distributed between 3rd parties (Coinbase, Gemini etc.).

Through a secure gossip network these price messages get pushed to Relayers.

Relayer then updates the price(s) on chain through Medianizer contract.

Knowing the above, the now dissolved Maker Foundation used to host and own 1 Feed and 4 Relayers to support Maker Oracle infrastructure.

As per Techops CU mandate which sets out to support Maker protocol's critical infrastructure, we submit this MIP to officially transfer the ownership of the above described Oracle assets from the old Maker Foundation to Techops CU.
